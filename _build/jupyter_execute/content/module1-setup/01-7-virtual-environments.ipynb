    "## Why Virtual Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing externally managed packages directly into the system Python can break core operating system tools that rely on specific Python configurations. To protect against this, Python ‚Äî an open-source language governed through a community-driven process called [PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)](https://peps.python.org/) ‚Äî adopted [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/). Introduced in Python 3.11 and supported by modern package managers like pip, PEP 668 allows the operating system (such as Ubuntu) to mark its Python installation as externally managed. This designation prevents `pip` from installing packages directly into the system Python environment, thereby encouraging the use of **virtual environments** for package management. There are two primary types of virtual environments: **Conda environments** (e.g., `base`, `envs/`) and **native Python virtual environments** created with `venv` (commonly stored in a `.venv` directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: PEP 668‚Äôs use of the term ‚Äúbase environment‚Äù refers to the system Python (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`), not the `base` environment of Conda, which is a separate self-managed Python installation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Python\n",
    "Lets start with an overview of what we have done.  When we installed Ubuntu via WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) we installed the system Python interpreter, and you can find where it is located by opening up the terminal (without activating any environment) and typing the following, `which python3`. To find the version of python type `python3 --version`. This is demonstrated with the following terminal session:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ which python3\n",
    "/usr/bin/python3\n",
    "rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ python3 --version\n",
    "Python 3.10.12\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the system is using Python 3.10.12, which was installed when I installed Ubuntu via WSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Miniconda Base Python\n",
    "When we installed miniconda3 it installed its own Python Interpreter. This is what we are calling the base conda environment and we must activate the base environment with `conda activate` to access its interpeter.  It is best not to install packages in this base environment, although it is common to install Jupyter Lab in the base environment.  Instead we make virtual environments for our projects and connect the Jupyter Lab to these via the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following terminal session activates the base environments, shows where the interpreter is and what its version is:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ conda activate\n",
    "(base) rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ which python3\n",
    "/home/rebelford/miniconda3/bin/python3\n",
    "(base) rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ python3 --version\n",
    "Python 3.12.1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "So miniconda3 installed python 3.12.1 in the bin directory of miniconda3. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda Env Environments\n",
    "Conda environments are in the miniconda3/envs folder and are not part of the project direcotry. When creating a conda environment it is best not to be in any environment, including the base. This can avoide confusion between the system and the base shells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Conda Environments\n",
    "1. Create env with a name and Python version\n",
    "   `conda create -n env_name python=X.Y`\n",
    "2. Activate the environment\n",
    "    `conda activate env_name`  \n",
    "3. Install kernel\n",
    "    `conda install ipykernel`\n",
    "4. Install other packages (give priority to conda and not pip) \n",
    "5. Register kernel\n",
    "    `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=env_name --display-name=\"Python_my_env(py.version)\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following terminal session shows my active conda environments\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ conda info --envs\n",

    "qspr                   /home/rebelford/miniconda3/envs/qspr\n",
    "```\n",
    "So you can see that the base is in the miniconda3 directory, and the four environments are in the envs subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "If we activate one of the environments we can see what version of python it is running.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rebelford@DESKTOP-LA8TH4L:~$ conda activate mordred_env\n",
