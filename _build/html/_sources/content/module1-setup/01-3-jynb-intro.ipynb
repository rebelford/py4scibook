    "# Overview of IDEs\n",
    "An IDE (Interactive Development Environment) is like a word processor for software development and offers several core features: We will go over them in lecture and you should be familiar with what they are, but we will probably not use them in class.  IDEs are really made for software development, and that is not really our goal.  So they excel at developing code, but the major shortcoming is that when you run code in an IDE, you are running an entire program (file).  In a jupyter lab you can run code one cell at a time. Some of the key features of an IDE are:\n",

    "# 2.  Jupyter vs. Python file types\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) and regular Python files (*.py) serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, rich text, visualizations, and other media, and can be run in Jupytter's ecosystem (notebooks, labs, hubs) or Google Collab (by simply uploading to your Google Drive). Python files are typically developed in Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) like PyCharm, VS-Code, Thonny, Spyder, etc, and are often run from the command line. There are also versions of Python (Circuit Python) that run on microcontrollers and can be implemented into embedded devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this course is to introduce students to Python packages of use to scientific discovery and many of the students will have no prior coding experience.  So after a lot of thought, I have decided to limit this course to the use of Jupyter Notebooks and not require students to use an IDE. There are some features, like Jupyter \"Magic Commands\" that only work in Notebooks, and we will do our best to avoid using them in the code we develop.  So you should be able to port your code to a different IDE and run it in other environments.\n",

    "- Magic commands (e.g., %matplotlib inline) may cause issues in regular Python environments.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Code is typically placed in a single cell, losing the interactive nature of notebooks.\n",
    "- Comments may be converted to markdown cells, but formatting might be lost.\n",

    "You can actually run Jupyter notebooks in your Google Drive using Google Colab. In this class you will be using both, but you are required to run your own Jupyter Lab server and can not use Google Colab for all assigments.  The reason is that you can not create virtual environments in Google Colab, and unless a package is installed by default, you have to reinstall it each time you open the notebook in Colab.\n",
