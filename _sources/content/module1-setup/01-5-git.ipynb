    "Git is a version control system that operates on your computer and allows you to track changes in your files over time, allowing you to save different versions of your work, revert to previous states, and collaborate with others. You install Git in your project folder by initializing it, which makes a special hidden .git directory. A directory with git installed is called a repository or repo. For science majors new to coding, Git provides a safety net as you experiment with your projects, allowing you to try new ideas without fear of losing your original work. It's an essential tool for managing the evolution of your research and coding projects, even if you're just starting out.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that builds upon Git's functionality by providing a centralized location to store and share your Git repositories online. GitHub offers a way to build a portfolio of your work, learn from others' code, and potentially collaborate on research projects with students and scientists around the world. It's a valuable resource for learning coding practices and engaging with the scientific community, even if you're just beginning your coding journey.\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git fetch origin\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reset Your Local Branch to Match the Remote:\n",
    "   Reset your local branch to match the remote branch (e.g., `main`). This will overwrite all tracked files in your local repository with the versions from the remote:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git reset --hard origin/main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This step discards any uncommitted changes in tracked files.\n",
    "   - Untracked files (files not added to Git) will remain untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remove Untracked Files (Optional):\n",
    "   If you want to clean up untracked files and directories, use:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clean -fd\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Use this only if you're sure you want to delete untracked files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pull the Latest Changes:\n",
    "   After resetting, you can pull any additional updates from the remote (though this is often unnecessary immediately after a reset):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git pull\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Instead of step 3 you can Merge the Updates into Your Local Branch\n",
    "Assuming you are on the default `main` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge origin/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This merges the changes from the remote `main` branch into your local branch. If your repository uses a different default branch, replace `main` with the appropriate branch name (e.g., `master`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Handle Merge Conflicts (if any)\n",
    "If there are conflicts, Git will notify you. Resolve conflicts manually by editing the affected files. After resolving:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mark the conflicts as resolved:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add <file>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Complete the merge:\n",
