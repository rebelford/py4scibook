    "Python is a type of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**), and we are going to start by looking at the difference between the procedural and the object oriented approach to summing numbers in a python data structure known as an array, or more accurately, the numpy array. We will start by generating an array of 8 random numbers, and by using a seed, we can reproduce the same array.  If we change the seed the numbers in the array will change. We will then create two different arrays and assign them to two variables called random_arrayA and random_arrayB. In the last step of the code we will print the array and the variable's class type. \n",

    "Objects are the core of Python's OOP model. They are instances of classes, combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity. Objects are created from classes, which are like blueprints that define the structure and behavior of the objects. For example, a NumPy array is an object created from the numpy.ndarray class. Classes allow us to group related data and behavior together, making our code more organized and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, an attribute is a piece of information stored in an object, like the shape of an array (array.shape), while a method is a function associated with an object that performs an action on it, like summing the elements of an array (array.sum()). An instance is a specific object created from a class, such as a particular array or dictionary you define in your code. These characteristics make Python a flexible and intuitive language for solving scientific problems, as you can work with data and its associated actions in a structured way.\n",

    "## 3.3. Externally Managed Packages and Modules\n",
    "One of the strengths of Python as an Open Source Software is that third parties can create their own customized libraries in the form of installable packages that can extend the capabilities of your programs. These packages can contain modules with functions and classes that are built on other modules, or the core built-in libraries. Because there are dependencies across packages it is important to install them in virtual environments and that is why we are using miniconda. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use these packages we have to first use conda commands in the terminal to install the package, and once installed, we need to import them in our python programs just was we import the built-in modules.  **It is very important to use conda to install these in the virtual environments.** There are two major repositories for obtaining python packages, the Python Package Index (PyPi) and Conda/Conda-Forge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda-Forge\n",
    "**[Conda-Forge](https://conda-forge.org/)** is a Git-Hub organization that as of January 2025 has over 28.5K packages and 0.81 billion monthly downloads. Conda-Forge is essentially focused on data science and scientific computing and has libraries in multiple programming languages besides Python. The conda package management system is very robust in handling the dependencies across multiple packages and this is the repository we will give priority to when installing externally managed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Package Index\n",
    "**[Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/)** is absolutely amazing and has over 600,000 python  projects as of January 2025, and is the go-to place for code for everything from sensors to data science packages. When you find packages you will often see a `pip install package-name` and this will install the package from PyPi.  In this class you are to first try and install packages using conda-forge, as it tends to be better in handling the complex dependencies, and integrates with your other packages that were installed with Conda.  There is another type of environment called `venv` that is part of the python standard library and pip integrates well with it, but as out class is going to be mixing multiple packages for different projects we will try and stick to Conda.  But PyPi is an awesome resource and we may find times where there are packages we need that can only be obtained through PyPi.  In those cases, it will be prudent to create a new environment for that project, just to be on the safe side.   "
