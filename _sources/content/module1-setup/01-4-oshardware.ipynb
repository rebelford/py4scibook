    "# 4. Computer Hardware Germane to Running a Program\n",
    "Your computing machine has many components to it and we are going to look at some of the key components used when running software on your computer. Our goal is to get a bearing on what happens when you load and run a Jupyter notebook.  PBS has a great Youtube channel for their [Crash Course in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) that is well worth the time to watch.\n",

    "     - **Memory Block** - unit of memory allocated to an object on the HEAP  \n",

    "- Stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.\n",
    "- **Levels**\n",
    "   - **L1 Cache** Closet to CPU, smallest and fastest\n",

    "   - **L3 Cache** Shared among CPU cores, largest and slowest.\n",

    "     - **Integrated GPU**: Built into the CPU, suitable for general tasks.\n",
    "     - **Dedicated GPU**: Separate hardware for high-performance tasks like gaming or 3D modeling.\n",

    "# 3. Steps When Running Jupyter Lab:\n",
    "1. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:\n",
    "   - A Conda environment with Jupyter is activated.\n",
    "   - The `jupyter-lab` command starts a local server, which the OS runs as a process.\n",
    "   - The server uses OS (Ubuntu) network interfaces to open a port (e.g., `localhost:8888`) for browser-based access. Note, you can run more than one localhost address at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open a Notebook**:\n",
    "   - The Jupyter Lab interface sends a request to the server to open a `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "   - The server spawns a kernel (IPython process) for the environment in which the notebook is running.\n",
    "   - This kernel is connected to the Conda Environment to ensure the needed libraries are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Execution**:\n",
    "   - When you run a code cell, the code is sent to the kernel.\n",
    "   - The kernel interacts with the Python interpreter within the Conda environment, which executes the code.\n",
    "   - Outputs are sent back to the notebook via the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **File Access and Visualization**:\n",
    "   - The notebook can read/write files on the system via Python, using OS file system APIs.\n",
    "   - Visualizations (e.g., plots) are rendered in the notebook interface using  libraries like matplotlib.\n"
